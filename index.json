In this paper, we propose a parallel curvature filter (PCF) that performs on GPU which is much faster than the original CF on CPU. Inspired by Convolution Neural Networks processed by GPU, the convolution operations in curvature filter computation can be similarly paralleled by GPU so that the PCF on a single GPU can process 33.2 Giga pixels per second. Such performance allows it to work in the real-time applications such as video processing and biomedical image processing, where high performance is required. Our experiments confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the PCF.","tags":null,"title":"Parallel curvature filter for high performance image processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" 项目简介 我们利用扫描仪和旋转平台搭建了一个自动扫描系统。 保证精确扫描每个物体，分辨率≈0.1mm，扫描用时\u0026lt;5分钟。\n Figure 1 实验系统 问题描述 现有的三维扫描技术扫描单个物体并不困难，但是建立一个三维数据库需要采集大量物体，需要耗费大量的人力成本，这也是当前三维扫描数据稀缺的原因。数据库的建立离不开一个自动扫描的方案，但是各种物体形状各异，软件算法对不同物体需要调整不同的参数，以及算法的稳定性也给自动化扫描带来了一定的困难。 要求：高鲁棒性算法，适应各种尺寸合适的物体。\n相关算法 逐帧匹配拼接(registration)：  Figure 2 点云和纹理拼接 环境噪点去除(outlier remove)  Figure 3 环境噪点去除 全局配准 (global registration)  Figure 4 多姿态全局配准 ","date":1546334465,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546334465,"objectID":"92b20f1d0cf15a39eab82aff4fc2ce35","permalink":"https://WillPanSUTD.github.io/project/3d-autoscan/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T17:21:05+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/3d-autoscan/","section":"project","summary":"三维自动扫描系统","tags":[],"title":"静态三维物体自动扫描(3D Autoscan)","type":"project"},{"authors":["Wei Pan","Lujie Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514736000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514736000,"objectID":"284923561b6c8c14df8f12e2dea95a90","permalink":"https://WillPanSUTD.github.io/publication/pan-2018-transformation/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pan-2018-transformation/","section":"publication","summary":"Container stacking is a common activity in various industries. At a large scale, the shipping industry stacks cargo containers, while at a smaller scale the home and office storage providers stack paper or plastic boxes. An interesting question behind container stacking is how to efficiently move containers from one stack to another. In this paper, we investigate a remotely related question: shape transformation between LEGO models. While many computational algorithms have been developed to construct LEGO models, the problem of constructing a LEGO model using bricks from an existing model has not been explored in open literature. We propose two objectives to optimize the transformation: the movement cost and the reuse rate of LEGO bricks. Two basic approaches coupled with three strategies are implemented to achieve shape transformation. Experiments and analysis reveal the efficiency of diﬀerent algorithms under several metrics of evaluation.","tags":null,"title":"Transformation of LEGO Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Pan","Lujie Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483200000,"objectID":"af774cba1e6ef3ade53e454c3e463db9","permalink":"https://WillPanSUTD.github.io/publication/pan-2017-design/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pan-2017-design/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Design of LEGO Assembly Transformation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Pan","Lujie Chen","Stylianos Dritsas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483200000,"objectID":"14f92ab52dba27ef3a94b87e10c58d5a","permalink":"https://WillPanSUTD.github.io/publication/pan-2017-pick/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pan-2017-pick/","section":"publication","summary":"We present an optimization method for process sequencing in automated assembly of three-dimensional physical structures comprised of uniform elements using robotic equipment. This is part of a process of large-scale construction based on a pick-and-place (PnP) assembly approach. We show that PnP process sequencing is a kind of assignment problem that can be solved by the Hungarian method. There exists a theoretical lower bound of the required work, while a feasible motion sequence may exceed the lower bound due to physical constraints. Subject to those particular constraints, we compare several process sequencing strategies against various data sets. Evaluated under a cost and a processing-time metrics, one of the strategies outperforms the rest. The approach adopted in the strategy may be generalized in different application-dependent scenarios, such as from crane operations to large scale 3D printing.","tags":null,"title":"Pick-and-place process sequencing for transformation of rasterized 3D structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Pan","Lujie Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420041600,"objectID":"59b4aa36b702c74fc7e4b58c9ea33831","permalink":"https://WillPanSUTD.github.io/publication/pan-2015-moving/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pan-2015-moving/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Moving Sequence Generation Based on Hungarian Method for Pick-and-Place Process","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guang Yuan Si","Eunice Sok Ping Leong","Wei Pan","Chan Choy Chum","Yan Jun Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388505600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388505600,"objectID":"26a920236c5881461bddccfac48e75b1","permalink":"https://WillPanSUTD.github.io/publication/si-2014-plasmon/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/si-2014-plasmon/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Plasmon-induced transparency in coupled triangle-rod arrays","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" http://opt.zju.edu.cn/zdgdjs/school/redir.php?catalog_id=2919\n项目简介 我们利用光电检测原理设计并制作一套音频声源定位与监听系统，利用激光束反射来检测确定室内声源的位置及声源播放内容，实现声音信号—光信号—微弱电信号—放大滤波—驱动扬声器这一过程并利用LABVIEW制作出一套定位系统，实现从双通道采集、波形分解、播放，再到求时延、定位的功能。\n问题描述 利用光电检测原理设计并制作一套音频声源定位与监听系统（以下简称“定位与监听系统”），放置于室外，利用激光束反射来检测确定室内声源的位置及声源播放内容。 要求：声源定位高准确度、和复原播放内容高信噪比，高准确度。\n1.设计出一套激光监听系统，实现声音信号—光信号—微弱电信号—放大滤波—驱动扬声器这一过程；\n Figure 1 监听原理图 2.制作出定位系统，由两个接收器接收信号并进行比较，测量出距离实现定位功能。  Figure 2 定位原理图 设计方案 “基于硅光电池、M-Audio MobilePre USB声卡和LabView的激光反射法声源定位系统”主要分为以下三大部分： 1. 硬件部分： （1）光电探测器件的选择——武汉搏盛的G0606M-I型硅光电池； （2）前置放大电路与滤波模块——NE5532放大滤波模块、LM7805和LM7905稳压模块； （3）功率放大电路——2.2W带立体声耳机输出双声道音频功率放大器模块；\n Figure 3 功放电路图  AD转换部分：双声道USB声卡M-Audio MobilePre（原计划使用NI的数据采集卡，资金不够）； 算法与软件部分：用LABVIEW编写一个程序，实现从双通道采集、波形分解、播放，再到求时延、定位的功能。   Figure 4 labview程序  外观   Figure 5 产品外观设计  Figure 6 比赛现场照片 ","date":1338724852,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1338724852,"objectID":"8728c42307258b69a915aa10568a51c1","permalink":"https://WillPanSUTD.github.io/project/laser-spy/","publishdate":"2012-06-03T20:00:52+08:00","relpermalink":"/project/laser-spy/","section":"project","summary":"设计制作了一套激光监听测距系统","tags":["optical design"],"title":"光电设计竞赛一等奖作品：激光监听测距 (Laser Spy)","type":"project"}]
