We show that our method can preserve features better than the popular uniform Laplacian-based denoising and it signiﬁcantly alleviates the shrinkage artifact. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HLO is better than or comparable to state-of-the-art techniques both qualitatively and quantitatively and that it is particularly good at handling meshes with high noise.
